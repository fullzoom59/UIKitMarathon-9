# UIKitMarathon-9
A collection with cells. Cells in one row. Horizontal scrolling

* Full screen collection
* The leftmost cell that fits all the way onto the screen is always indented to the left at the layout margins of the collection
* When you release the scroll, the cells stop at the rightmost margins
* If you do a hard scroll, the collection flies a couple of cells and stops at the rule above
* You can't use UICollectionViewCompositionalLayout

You can see similar collection behavior in the App Store app
